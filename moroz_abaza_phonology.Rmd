# Introduction

## General information about Abaza

In this article I describe two varieties of Tapanta dialect of Abaza (ISO-639-3 `abq`, glottocode `abaz1241`) spoken in two villages in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic: Inzhich-Chkun (in Abaza /jənˈdʒəɡʲ-tʃk'ʷən/) and Krasniy Vostok (in Abaza /ɡʷəmˈlokt/). Abaza is a language of the Abkhaz-Abaza group of Northwest Caucasian family of languages. After the Caucasian War (1817--1864) a lot of Abaza, Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe people were forced either to resettle from higher mountains or to immigrate to the Ottoman Empire. As a result Abaza people were split into those who remain in Russia (mostly in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic, see Figure \ref{fig:abaza-map} created with `lingtypology` [@moroz17]) and who moved to Turkey. According to the 2010 Russian census, there are slightly less than 38 thousand speakers of Abaza in Russia. The exact number of speakers in other countries, mainly in Turkey [@chirikba12: 21--23], is unknown. The data analyzed in this study were collected in 2018, 2019 and 2021 during a field trip to the villages. Even though traditionally Abaza is treated as a separate language with two dialects T'ap'anta and Shkharawa [@genko55: 5--7; @tabulova76: 3--4; @lomtatidze06: 98], some of the researches consider Abkhaz and Abaza to be a dialect continuum [e. g. @hewitt79: 1; @colarusso88: 7--9; @chirikba96]. However varieties of Inzhich-Chkun and Gumlokt belong to the same dialect, those lects have their own differences, e. g. *Abaza language* is /abaza bəz**ŝ**a/ in Inzhich-Chkun and /abaza bəz**ʂ**a/ in Gumlokt.

## State of research

Phonological inventory of Abaza can be found in multiple sources [@bouda40; @lomtatidze44; @genko55; @allen56; @tabulova76; @colarusso88; @oherin92; @chirikba96; @lomtatidze06; @arkadiev19; @oherin21], however more detailed phonological description is limited to [@bouda40; @lomtatidze44; @genko55; @catford72; @tabulova76; @colarusso88; @arkadiev19] and lack any acoustic analysis that appears just recently [@mamonova19]. It is also worth mentioning works by V. Chirikba [@chirikba85; @chirikba20], where he provides data from huge amount of Abaza settlements, explores correspondences of post-alveolar sibilants among them and compare obtained data with data from Abkhaz and Adyghe.

# Phonological inventory

Phonological inventory of T'ap'anta is present in Table \ref{tab:phon-system}. I illustrate[^trans_system] consonant inventory with some examples in Appendix 1.

[^trans_system]: In this work I will use two transcription systems. First system is my interpretation of Abaza phonology using IPA. Second is standard Abaza orthography. The IPA transcription used in this work differ from traditional Caucasian transcription, however Northwest Caucasian researchers still can retrieve desired information from orthographic correspondences. Unfortunately IPA alphabet still allows a lot of space for interpretation, so my system is differ from other recent phonological phonetic discriptions illustration of Northwest Caucasian languages (see [@gordon06; @andersson21]). I refuse to use symbols like ʃ, ʒ, ɕ or ʑ one can find in the literature for special post-alveolars sounds present in all Northwest Caucasian and continue to use symbols ŝ and ẑ after the following sources [@ladefoged96: 161--164; @catford94; @testelets09; @applebaum11; @paschen15]. \label{trans-system}


```{r phon-system}
read_csv("data/t_cons.csv") %>% 
  rename(` ` = X1) %>% 
  mutate_all(function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "", x)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", rep("c", 12)),
               caption = "Joint consonant system of Inzhich-Chkun and Gumlokt. Parenthesis denote the system that is common for Gumlokt, where the vast mojority of speakers use labialised post-alveolar segments.") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(0, angle = -90)
```

The main difference between Inzhich-Chkun and Gumlokt consonant systems is in post-alveolar consonants. All speakers of Inzhich-Chkun and some minority in Gumlokt use non-labialized post-alveolars (e. g. ŝ). The majority of speakers in Gumlokt use labialised post-alveolars (e. g. ŝʷ). Everything become even more complicated, since some post-alveolars in Inzhich-Chkun correspond to retroflex segments in Gumlokt. It looks like there is some proto-phonemes that merged together in most Abaza dialects except Gumlokt and Apsua (Ashkharywa dialect, [@lomtatidze06: 47, 445--446]): in Apsua in the same position labialized retroflex fricatives are observed:

(@sh) ŝə (Inzhich-Chkun), ʂə (Gumlokt), ʂʷə (Apsua) --- 'door'
(@zh) ẑə (Inzhich-Chkun), ʐə (Gumlokt), ʐʷə (Apsua) --- 'old'

Presented examples show that the post-alveolar correspondences between Inzhich-Chkun and Gumlokt not predictable without Gumlokt or Apsua data (see Table \ref{tab:post_alveolar}), so I decided to collect some lexicon that could be useful for further historical and dialectal investigation (see Appendix 2).

```{r post_alveolar}
read_csv("data/t_post_alveolar.csv") %>% 
  rename(` ` = X1) %>% 
  mutate_all(function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "", x)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", rep("c", 12)),
               caption = "Post-alveolar correspondences between Inzhich-Chkun and Gumlokt.") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position"), full_width = FALSE) 
```

Except of my interpretation of alveolar and retroflex consonants (see the footnote on the page \pageref{trans-system}) the main difference between my phonological description and older ones is in the palatal area: I treat segments cʰ, c', and ɟ  as palatal, however more traditional interpretation is palatalised velars: kʲ, k', and ɡʲ.

(c. f. with [@chirikba85; @chirikba20], [@lomtatidze44]) weak labialised post-alveolars.
