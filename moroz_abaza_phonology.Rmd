# Introduction

## General information about Abaza

In this article I describe two varieties of Tapanta dialect of Abaza (glottocode `abaz1241`) spoken in two villages in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic: Inzhich-Chukun (in Abaza /jənˈdʒəɡʲ-tʃk'ʷən/) and Krasniy Vostok (in Abaza /ɡʷəmˈlokt/). Abaza is a language of the Abkhaz-Abaza group of Northwest Caucasian family of languages. After the Caucasian War (1817--1864) a lot of Abaza, Abkhaz, Ubykh and Adyghe people were forced either to resettle from higher mountains or to immigrate to the Ottoman Empire. As a result Abaza people were split into those who remain in Russia (mostly in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic) and who moved to Turkey. According to the 2010 Russian census, there are slightly less than 38 thousand speakers of Abaza in Russia. The exact number of speakers in other countries, mainly in Turkey [@chirikba12: 21--23], is unknown. The data analyzed in this study were collected in 2018, 2019 and 2021 during a field trip to the villages. Even though traditionally Abaza is treated as a separate language with two dialects T'ap'anta and Shkharawa [@genko55: 5--7; @tabulova76: 3--4; @lomtatidze06: 98], some of the researches consider Abkhaz and Abaza to be a dialect continuum [e. g. @hewitt79: 1; @colarusso88: 7--9; @chirikba96]. However varieties of Inzhich-Chukun and Krasniy Vostok belong to the same dialect, those lects have their own differences, e. g. *Abaza language* is /abaza bəz**ŝ**a/ in Inzhich-Chukun and /abaza bəz**ʂ**a/ in Krasnyj Vostok.

## State of research

Phonological inventory of Abaza can be found in multiple sources [@bouda40; @genko55; @allen56; @tabulova76; @colarusso88; @oherin92; @chirikba96; @lomtatidze06; @arkadiev19; @oherin21], however more detailed phonological description is limited to [@genko55; @tabulova76; @colarusso88; @arkadiev19] and lack any acoustic analysis that appears just recently [@mamonova19].

# Consonants

```{r}
read_csv("data/t_cons.csv", col_names = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate_all(function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "", x)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", rep("c", 12)),
               caption = "Consonant system of most speakers from Inzhich-Chukun and Krasniy Vostok",
               col.names = NULL)
```
